Power shell vs python

See for yourself, PowerShell vs Python Benchmarking

In this example, I use PowerShell + C# script vs. Python.

Note: PowerShell scripts can run on Windows and Linux machines with the appropriate installations. With PowerShell, it's possible to create dynamic scripts similar to Python.

Windows 10 and 11 also work with PowerShell + C#, but only if the script is compatible with PowerShell 5.1.

It is also possible to run PowerShell + C# with a Dockerfile as long as you use the image: FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0
